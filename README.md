  ### Project structured like this 
  
# Day 1:
Study and understand the requirements and the basics of file handling in C, especially the open and read functions. You should also familiarize yourself with the prototypes and descriptions of the functions that are allowed to be used in this project (read, malloc, free).

# Day 2:
Start writing the  [get_next_line.c](https://github.com/alessiotucci/get_next_line/blob/master/get_next_line.c) | description |
 function by allocating memory for the line to be read and using the read function to get the data from the file. Make sure to also implement a mechanism to determine when a line has been completely read, such as checking for the newline character.

# Day 3:
Test your get_next_line function with different files and inputs to ensure it works as expected and returns the correct output. Debug and fix any issues that may arise.

# Day 4:
Optimize your code to improve its performance and efficiency, if necessary. Write comments and documentation for your code to make it readable and understandable for others. Make any final touches and clean up your code.

Note: This is just a suggested working plan and can be adjusted based on individual needs and speed. The most important thing is to understand the requirements and the basics of file handling in C before starting the implementation.

| [`My original version`](https://github.com/alessiotucci/get_next_line/blob/master/original_version.c) | In my original version, I had a static int that works as counter and helps me iterate throught the string, but the function was too long for Norminette so I was forced to change approach |
